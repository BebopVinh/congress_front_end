# README


## Welcome to your Who's Who in the 116th Congress!

NOTE: this app has two Github repositories. This one is for the React-Redux front_end. The other one is for the Rails API (back_end); the other repo (Link in instructions below.)

You can use this web app to search and sort all 542 members of the 116th United States Congress.

Just click on House or Senate, and then use the sort buttons or search field. It's fun to check out who missed the most votes!

Each member's card shows her full contact information, including social media accounts and a website link.

Future versions of this app will include information on who belongs to what committee, and which bills they are sponsoring. I would also like to add a quiz element. For instance, I can I can remove the senator's name from the front of the card and see if you can guess who's who!

I hope you can use this free app to learn more about Congress.

## Usage

To run this app:

PART ONE - GO to https://github.com/joanrig/congress_api
and follow the instructions to run the Congress_API back_end. Then return here.


When you have your rails server running and pointed to http://localhost:3000/ , you should see a JSON-formatted list of all Congress members. Then continue:

PART TWO:

5. Clone this repo.

6. Run npm install and npm start. You will be asked if you would like to run the program on another server. Type "Y" for Yes.

Your browser will automatically launch the Who's Who in Congress app to its home page.

You can shut down both servers by typing Control C in the terminal window where they are running.

###More about React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
